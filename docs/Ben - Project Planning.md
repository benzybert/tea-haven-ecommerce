### **Project Roadmap**

#### **Step 1: Understand the Polymarket API**

1. **Review the Documentation:**  
   * Familiarize yourself with the API’s capabilities by reviewing its documentation.  
   * Focus on understanding:  
     * The available endpoints and what data they provide.  
     * Authentication methods like API keys or tokens.  
     * How requests and responses are structured.  
     * Any rate limits or quotas enforced by the API.  
2. **Decide What Data to Use:**  
   * Clearly define the use case for the project—what kind of information do we want to retrieve from Polymarket?  
   * Create a list of endpoints that are most relevant to your project goals and prioritize them.

#### **Step 2: Set Up a Backend Project on GitHub**

1. **Initialize the Project:**  
   * Use Node.js for the backend. Start by initializing the project.  
   * Set up version control by creating a GitHub repository to track your work.  
2. **Build the Core Functionality of the Backend:**  
   * Set up a basic server using a framework like Express or Fastify.  
     * For example, use `app.listen()` to start the server.  
   * Plan for basic routes (e.g., `GET` and `POST`) to serve data.  
   * If needed, include basic API key authentication to validate client requests to your backend.  
3. **Organize the Project Architecture:**  
   * Create directories to structure your code for better organization:  
     * **`app`/** \- Contains the main setup and configuration files for the server and application.  
     * **`config/`** \- Stores configuration files, such as API keys, database settings, and environment variables.  
     * **`modules/`** \- Divided into feature-specific modules, each containing controllers, services, repositories, and models for handling different functionality.  
     * **`utils/`**\- Contains reusable helper functions and utilities, such as logging, error handling, and API helpers.  
     * **`docs/`** \- Documentation for the project, including API references and architectural details.

#### **Step 3: Integrate the Polymarket API**

1. **Check for NPM Packages:**  
   * Look for existing npm packages for Polymarket integration. If a package exists and meets your needs, use it to save development time.  
   * If there’s no package, proceed by making HTTP calls to the Polymarket API manually.  
2. **Make HTTP Calls to the Polymarket API:**  
   * Use libraries like `axios` or `node-fetch` to interact with the Polymarket API.  
   * Centralize these API interactions in a dedicated service module within the `apis/` directory. Example: A function to fetch active markets from Polymarket.  
3. **Expose Backend Endpoints:**  
   * Create routes in the `routes/` directory for your backend endpoints, such as:  
     * `/markets`: To fetch and display a list of all active markets.  
     * `/market/:id`: To fetch specific details about a single market.  
   * These routes will call your service functions to retrieve and process the required data.

#### **Notes:**

* Implement **basic error handling** to manage issues like:  
  * API rate limits (e.g., 429 errors).  
  * Unexpected response errors or timeouts.  
* Write **modular code** so that each function or route has a single responsibility. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.  
* Add basic **logging** to track the flow of your application and debug issues. You can use `console.log` or integrate a logging library like `winston` for more advanced functionality.

Workflow:

1. Work on a “dirty” branch  
2. Pull
